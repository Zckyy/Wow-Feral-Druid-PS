**PvE Druid of The Claw Feral Druid**

A fully automated Feral Druid rotation script for Midnight Expansion, optimized for the Druid of the Claw hero specialization from the Midnight expansion.

This rotation follows the latest SIMC APL for Druid of the Claw.

I will update this to work with Wildstalker if we ever end up playing Wildstalker in midnight.

Features:

Handling cooldowns intelligently - Uses Berserk, Convoke, and Feral Frenzy based on Time-to-Die thresholds and Tiger's Fury. These can also be manually toggled on/off.
Detecting AoE vs Single Target - Automatically switches between rotations based on nearby enemies.
Keeping you alive - Uses Barkskin and Survival Instincts based on health thresholds.
Utility - Maintains Mark of the Wild, Cat Form, and Prowl outside of combat. Auto shapeshift forms when rooted.
